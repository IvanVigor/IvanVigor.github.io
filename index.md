# [Balanced Graph Partitioning](https://github.com/IvanVigor/Balanced_Graph_Partitioning)

Github code implementation for "Balanced Graph Partitioning" paper (authors: Konstantin Andreev, Harald Racke). In this paper it's considered the problem of (k, ν)-balanced
graph partitioning - dividing the vertices of a graph into k almost equal size components so that the capacity of edges between different components
is minimized.

# [Leveraging High Dimensional Side Information for top-N Recs](https://github.com/IvanVigor/Leveraging-High-Dimensional-Side-Information-for-Top-N-Recommendation)

Top-N recommender systems typically utilize side information to address the problem of data sparsity. Augmented Lagrange Multiplier and Alternating Direction Method are applied to efficiently solve the problems. Experiment results demonstrate the superior recommendation quality of the proposed algorithm to that of the state-of-the-art alternatives.


# [Reinforcement Learning Deep Q-Learning Network Unity Collector](https://github.com/IvanVigor/Deep-Q-Learning-Network-Unity-collector)

In this reinforcement learning scenario, the agent's goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward. The reward can be accumulated by collecting yellow bananas. Thanks to the usage of Unity 3D environment, the network is trained by exploring the environment by itself. The Q-Learning network is provided using Pytorch.
